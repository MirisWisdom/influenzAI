# influenzAI

**Conveniently providing trustworthy information to people suffering from Influenza and Long COVID, using AI trained on reputable government data, and with an emphasis on privacy.**

**During the COVID pandemic, we have seen an incredible amount of misinformation spreading on the Internet. An effective mitigation is allowing easy, convenient and intuitive access to reputable information. This is where influenzAI tries to fill in the gap, by allowing the user to query a model trained on trusted, reputable open government data.**

## Accessibility

1. Querying is done using natural language prompts, instead of scrolling through oceans of documents
2. Using features such as voice to text, we improve convenience by reducing typing on phonesâ€¦
   - for busy medical practitioners
   - and accessibility to people new to this technology
3. A minimalist, responsive UI

## Privacy

Privacy is paramount in healthcare, which is why our solution uses a self-hosted ML trained on open government data.

Queries do not get exposed to third-party solutions, and we refrain from gathering personal information from people.

## Bias Mitigation

Our architecture and self-hosted model grants us control over our model, and thus permits us to minimise external bias. The challenge of bias lies in the government data itself, which we can curate using an ethical protocol.

## Interactive and Visual

To improve the depth of responses, we are building our own system which visualises government data using intuitive, useful charts and maps. This bespoke system would respond to known queries (e.g. "long covid trends in 2023") using visual responses, as a complement to the text-based responses from our ML.

## Openness and Transparency

To improve openness and transparency, we can visually display all the documents/datasets used for our model.
